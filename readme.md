## OpenNFS1
OpenNFS1 is a ground-up remake of the original EA Need for Speed 1. The code is all written from scratch without reverse engineering executables, and it uses the original data files that were on the CD back in 1995! The format of the various binary data files was worked out by Ian Brown, Denis Auroux and myself.

## Main features
  * Written in C# and XNA. (Now converted to Monogame)
  * 16 tracks with scenery, animations, tunnels
  * 9 drivable cars with animated dashboards
  * Can drive tracks backwards (not allowed in the original)
  * Can drive past the finish signs on open road stages to see the real end of the track (probably never seen by anyone except by the original developers!)

## Requires
  * OpenAL
  * Monogame >= 3.2.0
  * .NET 4
